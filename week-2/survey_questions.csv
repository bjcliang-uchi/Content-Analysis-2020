"Taiwan held elections for the president and all the members of the Legislative Yuan on January 11. Although President Tsai Ing-wen had maintained a strong lead in the polls, there were questions about the reliability of some polls. Moreover, the outcome of the legislative elections was very uncertain. China, which has long made clear its dislike of the Tsai administration, had predictably intensified its pressure campaign against Tsai and Taiwan, hoping to impact these elections. In the end, Tsai Ing-wen was reelected, and the Democratic Progressive Party maintained its majority in the Legislative Yuan.",

"This problem has not escaped notice. In 2000, for example, the leaders of the African Union pledged to dedicate 15 percent of government spending to the health sector. Using this as a benchmark, most LMICs fall far short. On average, LMICs with higher incomes do spend almost four times as much as the poorer countries, but there can be big differences between countries with similar per capita incomes. In our current work, we are looking more closely at six countries that span the lower-middle income spectrum: Kenya, Myanmar, Ghana, India, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka (upper-middle income since July 1, 2019).",
"The punishment for being a Christian is quick and decisive. “It’s not uncommon for believers to be beheaded. There’s no trial. There’s no kangaroo court [or] anything like that. This is where Islamic extremism really shows itself in that top 10 and even beyond, so many of these countries … .",
"Consider a fairly straightforward case: converting farmland into a new subdivision of single-family houses in a suburban area or small town.

"San Francisco has been called the Paris of the West, but lately, it’s become a nightmare. Rows of tents now line the sidewalks, and the air smells foul. Homelessness is out of control.  We discuss Kate’s recent feature on what’s going on in America’s most liberal city. ",
"His 2014 Presidential Pork: White House Influence over the Distribution of Federal Grants demonstrates that pork-barrel politics occurs beyond the halls of Congress. Presidents capitalize on their discretionary funding authority to target federal dollars to swing states in advance of presidential elections. His other work explores how agency staffing, expertise, and institutional structure facilitate or hinder presidential power and influence. This research explores the balance between political control and bureaucratic expertise in the delivery of public policy.",
"I think a lot of conservatives are interested in that because it would break up the monopoly that, among other things, is indoctrinating a new generation of people. ",

"As we’re starting off a new decade, we here at the Future of the Middle Class Initiative are feeling a little nostalgic. So we’ve decided to go beyond simply looking at our work from the last year or two, and instead look back over the entire decade. After all, previous work from our home Center, the Center on Children and Families, and its scholars continues to provide context for our current work on everything from the income and wealth of the middle class, to paid leave, tax credits to make work pay, access to college, housing markets, gender gaps in the effects of automation, and much more. So get ready for the new decade with us by reviewing some of our best pieces from the 2010s. Happy New Decade, everyone!",
"What about the transition to market economy? The answer: not enough. Some progress was made during the early years of transition. But today, apart from Kazakhstan, the countries of the region are the lowest ranked among the states of the former Soviet Union on the extent of transition to market. The presence of the government and state-owned enterprises in the economy remains large, the private sector is often intertwined with the public one, and the risks of expropriation have remained elevated.",
"“Even though it’s tough, and it’s hard and there are sleepless nights, and sometimes you can’t do what you want to do, you want to make sacrifices,” Watson said. “I’ve never heard anybody say when they get older, ‘I wish I had less kids.’”",

"The other thing to remember, too, is he signed a trade deal with Japan recently, which people forget, and that is a huge deal as well, with big commitments for purchases from American companies, produced in the United States.",
"Opposition to subsidy reform is so strong because consumer subsidies are at the heart of the unspoken social compact in which Arab citizens give up their voice and tolerate low government accountability in exchange for subsidies, free education and medical care, and public jobs. That social contract is being tested by a burgeoning youth population and emptying budget coffers. Dissatisfaction is exacerbated by the failure of many Arab states to deliver adequate services in the subsidized sectors such as public transportation. In many Arab countries, private and mostly informal operators provide the lion’s share of transportation services. These operators stepped in where the state failed to deliver and in many ways the fuel subsidy was a transfer in kind to compensate the non-state operators for doing the state’s job. The removal of fuel subsidy is perceived by the often-large number of small operators as a transfer from their pockets to those of a state that has done nothing to deserve it.",
